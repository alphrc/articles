Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping economic structures at an unprecedented pace. Companies are increasingly automating labor, reaping enormous efficiency gains and profits. However, this transformation brings a significant¬†*negative externality*: while corporations benefit from reduced costs, the resulting surge in unemployment shifts the burden of welfare and social security to governments and society at large. As traditional jobs vanish, wages decline faster than prices, leading to diminished consumer demand and growing structural inequalities.

### The Corporate AI Tax: Addressing Externalities

To mitigate this externality, governments may impose an "AI tax" on companies that replace human labor with automation. Such a tax could fund welfare programs and unemployment benefits, easing the societal costs of mass job displacement. Additionally, it would raise the cost threshold for full automation, preserving the competitiveness of human labor in the market.

Although automation may lower the costs of goods and services, these price reductions often lag behind the rapid decline in wages, leaving workers unable to sustain their consumption. The AI tax could offset this imbalance by redistributing some of the gains from automation to those most affected, ensuring a degree of economic stability during the transition to an automated economy.

### Toward a "Labor-Free" Economy: From AI Tax to Universal Allocation

As AI matures and requires minimal supervision or maintenance, production costs could shrink to the bare essentials‚Äîenergy and raw materials. At this stage, goods and services would become exceedingly affordable, and governments could use AI tax revenues to issue "vouchers" or a form of¬†*universal basic income (UBI)*¬†to distribute these benefits equitably. These vouchers would directly reflect the net output of AI systems, making them stable in value as long as AI maintains high productivity.

In such a system, the traditional link between labor and income would dissolve. Citizens would receive these vouchers as their share of AI-generated wealth, securing their access to basic goods and services even in the absence of jobs. While these vouchers may not be freely tradable to prevent inequitable accumulation, they would guarantee universal access to essential resources and maintain economic demand.

### The Energy-Based Economy: A New Paradigm

Eventually, as advancements in AI and algorithms plateau, the bottleneck for production will no longer lie in technological sophistication but in the availability of physical resources and energy. Energy will emerge as the critical factor constraining production, giving rise to what could be termed an "energy-based economy." In this paradigm, the total volume of goods and services a society can consume will be determined by its access to energy, not labor.

The value of UBI or similar mechanisms would then hinge on society's energy resources. Governments might redirect AI tax revenues to secure and manage energy supplies, ensuring that AI-driven productivity continues to benefit all citizens. In this way, the economy shifts from being labor-centric to resource-centric, with energy as its ultimate foundation.

### A New Balance and Future Challenges

The corporate AI tax may begin as a stopgap measure to address the immediate disruptions of automation, but it could evolve into a cornerstone of a new economic order. It offers a pathway to a future where AI-driven efficiency coexists with social equity, allowing humanity to share in the productivity dividends of automation without succumbing to the pitfalls of mass unemployment and economic stagnation.

These ideas are not mere speculation. As production costs approach near-zero labor inputs, society will face inevitable choices about how to distribute wealth and resources. The real competition in the future will likely revolve around access to energy and raw materials rather than traditional labor costs. Balancing efficiency and fairness in this energy-based economy will be one of the defining challenges of our time.
